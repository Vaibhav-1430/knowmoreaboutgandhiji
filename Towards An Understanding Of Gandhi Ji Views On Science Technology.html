  <h2 style="color:steelblue">Towards An Understanding Of Gandhi's Views On Science</h2>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="column">
      <p style="font-size:15px;text-align: justify;">Gandhi, it is argued in this paper, was not anti-science as is
        commonly
        misunderstood. Through a look at his various experiments, many unrealized in his time, it is shown that Gandhi's
        life defined a space for an alternative science for civil society that would operate with different methods.
        Gandhi's focus on the non-physical resources in organizing for science, the satyagrahi scientist, for instance,
        is
        a radical departure from science policy as expressed by Nehru in his famous Scientific Policy Resolution of 1956
        and followed in India since independence. He also had a universal message by providing a new cosmology of
        man-nature and fact-value relations that he articulated and put in place through his various experiments.With
        this
        outline of a theoretical framework for Gandhian science, the case of the khadi movement is taken up for detailed
        explication.<br><br>A reading of the rather extensive literature on Gandhi reveals that his views on science
        rarely find mention, almost to the point of exclusion. Based on his critique of modern civilization and the
        sheer
        lack of material on his views on science Gandhi has been labelled as anti-science. This has not been addressed
        adequately either by his follower or by social analysis of Gandhi's philosophy and practice. In this paper
        focusing on his Collected Works (CW) (1888-1948) we seek to address this lacuna by presenting a detailed
        contextual collation and analysis of his views on science over the years. We look at the responses of scholars
        to
        these representations. We then present new material on Gandhi's views on the subject that have been ignored and
        stand in need of analysis. The readings presented here would in our opinion have the potential of answering
        squarely some of Gandhi's critics who saw his views as retrograde. This 'archive', it is hoped, will contribute
        to
        equalizing the focus in Gandhian studies from an overemphasis on his political philosophy to his contribution to
        intellectual history and the sociology of knowledge.</p>

  <h2 style="color: steelblue;">Mahatma and machines: Understanding Gandhi's thoughts on modern technology</h2>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="column">
      <p style="font-size:15px;text-align: justify;">Father of our nation, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi is known for many
        things. From his
        thoughts on caste, creed and religion to his teachings of ahimsa and communal harmony, the Mahatma was a man who
        crafted the future of our country with the power of his ideas.However, despite his ability to accept
        contemporary
        ways of living without distancing himself from the teachings of the past, the Mahatma was somebody who till the
        very end remained wary of what the modern way of life could bring with itself in the future.And the biggest
        proof
        of this is his oft-cited distrust of technology and the impact it could have on human life. Throughout his life,
        Gandhiji remained sceptical about the role modern technology could play in our lives and did his bit in
        persuading
        people to steer clear of the industrial revolution that was sweeping over the western world and had slowly
        started
        to take root in India too. And in his attempts to stop the industrialisation of India along the lines of what
        was
        being seen in the West, Gandhiji also became a vocal critic of the growing use of machines for increasing
        manufacturing output. </p>
